{"id":"d9b98accbacb753312f0dc0efb1bd446577670a4","title":"Neutralization of errors and attacks in wireless ad hoc networks","paperAbstract":"This paper proposes and evaluates strategies to build reliable and secure wireless ad hoc networks. Our contribution is based on the notion of inner-circle consistency, where local node interaction is used to neutralize errors/attacks at the source, both preventing errors/attacks from propagating in the network and improving the fidelity of the propagated information. We achieve this goal by combining statistical (a proposed fault-tolerant cluster algorithm) and security (threshold cryptography) techniques with application-aware checks to exploit the data/computation that is partially and naturally replicated in wireless applications. We have prototyped an inner-circle framework with the ns-2 network simulator, and we use it to demonstrate the idea of inner-circle consistency in two significant wireless scenarios: (1) the neutralization of black hole attacks in AODV networks and (2) the neutralization of sensor errors in a target detection/localization application executed over a wireless sensor network.","authors":[{"name":"Claudio  Basile","ids":["2125028"]},{"name":"Zbigniew T.

In this context, specifying, deploying and then updating a security policy is a complex task. In the vast majority of cases, this task is being carried out in an artisanal way; administrators must manually configure the different changes that can occur in the security policy in different levels of security architecture components of the system. In this paper we propose a dynamic approach based on the weaving of aspects for the deployment of a security policy that includes the access control and usage control rules.","authors":[{"name":"Samiha  Ayed","ids":["2036640"]},{"name":"Muhammad Sabir Idrees","ids":["35060586"]},{"name":"Nora  Cuppens-Boulahia","ids":["1398231440"]},{"name":"Frédéric  Cuppens","ids":["1727009"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["d41b12660364b91cb32847334e123c6219587049","a75cf00c0b8ff22713bcb89ea6d1610affbd29a4","f9336edf918e78e3ffd7622bbcf13efea39fd644","8cc3d3a04745a81a7a49209452b1b9f843693deb","ad6c7a23a2dcf5f77b5acb48fe85410aa7685db7","202d526b6cb10e57988cc30d7d7880131d123e8d","3aa04e10a1e4495370df766e702378ba57694057","fede6057fd5550a325565517c8588e63ddd34e0e","290c25edf11e9d8160f3fb57a8177cf403a80769","564f4e8cbc289f86c8ed470ea3edd1dba5bb023a"],"year":2015,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/80c7f0ac16f7e8a4a590a12779314c67f6fca89d","sources":["DBLP"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/NOTERE.2015.7293500"],"venue":"2015 International Conference on Protocol Engineering (ICPE) and International Conference on New Technologies of Distributed Systems (NTDS)","journalName":"2015 International Conference on Protocol Engineering (ICPE) and International Conference on New Technologies of Distributed Systems (NTDS)","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"1-6","doi":"10.1109/NOTERE.2015.7293500","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOTERE.2015.7293500","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Engineering","Computer Science"],"magId":"1644809209","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]}
